# Pipline for My own Project

### Note:

This project is a Golang tutorial built with Docusaurus, created as part of my learning journey with Golang.

### Workflow:

I don't want to deploy on every commit. I think Docusaurus has a default workflow pipeline that allows me to deploy manually using the 'deploy' command, which publishes my site to GitHub Pages. This is exactly what I want, as I'm writing a series of tutorials and prefer to deploy only when I feel the whole section is complete.

### Personal Note:

I would greatly appreciate it if you could offer tutorials on advanced software development topics using Golang, including the creation of custom databases and cloud-based applications. This would provide developers with the opportunity to gain practical experience in building complex, scalable systems using Go
